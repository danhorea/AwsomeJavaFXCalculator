AwsomeJavaFXCalculator
======================

A cool looking Java calculator using JavaFx 2.
The view was designed using an fxml file, edited with Scene Builde, and then styled with css.
The backgound is transparent for a cool modern look, and the window can be dragged.

In order to run the eclipse project, jfxrt.jar must be added to the build path.
